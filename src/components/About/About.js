with over 15 years in the gaming industry.
1Kball games are a revolution in the lottery betting industry which required great effort to develop.

After market research we have come to know that what we need for the organization
of our games currently does not exist anywhere else and, as such, everything had to be built from scratch.

This venture has meant great engagement of engineers to meet the conditions that we

have filled the space with new industry games and a new kind of offer.

Every piece of equipment is designed to last incomparably longer than anything currently on the market.
It is because it was developed for the purposes of the draws and games with high frequency in
comparison to classic live lotteries. In this way, and with the new technology we are closer
to the frequency of virtual games, but we maintain the credibility
of the lottery games with a live video feed from the Studio.`}/>
